	<h3> Are you Happy? Well Rested? </h3>
	<p>Sleep, sleep, then sleep better. Nothing can stop you if you're never stoping yourself. Door knob, door closed. Eyes closed. It's time for bed again! It's a cycle of sleep right? Sleep with your other, your other other, too. I hope she's not too tired, I hope she sleeps the way I sleep. Nothing matters if you don't matter. Sleep, sleep, morning never comes! <a href="https://weather.com/" target="_blank"> [if the sun never rises]</a></p>

A long shot - I was in for my routine checkup tuesday and you were observing as an intern. I thought you were incredibly cute and wanted to flirt, but it didn't seem the right place.

	<br>You: built white guy showing off your cock in the locker room. 
	<br>Me: tall skinny white guy, hairy with facial hair.
	<br>We did a lot of showing off to each other and you walk down to the end of the locker room to watch me changing. We headed up the stairs together but you went to workout and I was leaving. I'd be interested in meeting up at the gym sometime.
