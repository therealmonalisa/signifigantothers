<div> <!-- something about sleep-->
	<p><i>You're reading nothing of importance, nothing of importance, nothing of importance</i></p>

	<h3> Are you Happy? Well Rested? </h3>
	<p>Sleep, sleep, then sleep better. Nothing can stop you if you're never stoping yourself. Door knob, door closed. Eyes closed. It's time for bed again! It's a cycle of sleep right? Sleep with your other, your other other, too. I hope she's not too tired, I hope she sleeps the way I sleep. Nothing matters if you don't matter. Sleep, sleep, morning never comes! <a href="https://weather.com/" target="_blank"> [if the sun never rises]</a></p>

<div> <!-- a purple pain -->
		<h3>My gut falls through my ribs, below my stomach, into my pelvis: can't stop thinking of .... ah.... </h3>
		<p> <i>a purple kind of pain. </i>[a purple kind of pain]President Trump confirmed on Thursday morning that he supports legislation that would protect young undocumented immigrants from deportation and would deliver a “massive” increase in border security — but not with a wall on the southern border. A long shot - I was in for my routine checkup tuesday and you were observing as an intern. I thought you were incredibly cute and wanted to flirt, but it didn't seem the right place. I would love to meet up and chat with you, and now that you've seen me naked (cough), perhaps you could return the favor ;-)

		Tell me your first name so I'll know it's you!
		<br>You: built white guy showing off your cock in the locker room. 
		<br>Me: tall skinny white guy, hairy with facial hair.
		<br>We did a lot of showing off to each other and you walk down to the end of the locker room to watch me changing. We headed up the stairs together but you went to workout and I was leaving. I'd be interested in meeting up at the gym sometime.
